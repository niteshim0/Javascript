## Does JavaScript really have classes ?

JavaScript does have classes, but it's important to understand that JavaScript's class system is based on prototypes rather than traditional class-based languages like Java or C++. JavaScript introduced class syntax in ECMAScript 2015 (ES6) to make it easier for developers familiar with classical object-oriented languages to work with JavaScript.

Here's a basic example of how classes work in JavaScript:

```javascript
class Animal {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
  }

  speak() {
    console.log(`${this.name} makes a sound.`);
  }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
  constructor(name, breed) {
    super(name);
    this.breed = breed;
  }

  speak() {
    console.log(`${this.name} barks.`);
  }
}

const dog = new Dog('Buddy', 'Labrador');
dog.speak(); // Output: Buddy barks.
```

Under the hood, JavaScript's classes are syntactical sugar over JavaScript's existing prototype-based inheritance. They provide a more familiar syntax for creating objects and managing inheritance, but they still rely on prototypes behind the scenes.

So, while JavaScript doesn't have traditional classes like some other languages, it does provide a way to work with classes and inheritance through its prototype system.

## What do you mean by Objects in Javascript ?


In JavaScript, an object is a fundamental data type that represents a collection of key-value pairs. Objects are used to store data and organize code in a structured way. Unlike primitive data types such as numbers and strings, which hold a single value, objects can hold multiple values and even functions.

Here's a basic example of creating an object in JavaScript:

```javascript
// Creating an object
let person = {
  firstName: "John",
  lastName: "Doe",
  age: 30,
  greet: function() {
    console.log("Hello, my name is " + this.firstName + " " + this.lastName + ".");
  }
};

// Accessing object properties
console.log(person.firstName); // Output: John
console.log(person.age); // Output: 30

// Calling object method
person.greet(); // Output: Hello, my name is John Doe.
```

JavaScript objects are highly flexible, allowing properties to hold various types of data, including numbers, strings, arrays, other objects, and functions. Additionally, objects can be dynamically modified by adding or removing properties and methods at runtime.

Objects in JavaScript are essential for organizing code, modeling real-world entities, and implementing complex data structures and algorithms. They serve as the foundation for many advanced programming concepts in JavaScript, including object-oriented programming, functional programming, and module patterns.

## Explain Object literal ?

An object literal is a way to create and define objects in JavaScript using a concise and straightforward syntax. It allows you to define an object and its properties and methods in a single expression, enclosed within curly braces `{}`.

Here's a basic example of an object literal:

```javascript
let person = {
  firstName: "John",
  lastName: "Doe",
  age: 30,
  greet: function() {
    console.log("Hello, my name is " + this.firstName + " " + this.lastName + ".");
  }
};
```

Object literals provide a convenient way to create objects on the fly without the need for explicit constructor functions or class definitions. They are commonly used for creating simple data structures, configuration objects, and more.

Object literals are versatile and can contain various types of data, including strings, numbers, arrays, other objects, and even functions. They can also be nested within each other to create more complex structures.

## Explain Constructor Functions in Javascript ?

### Constructor Functions in JavaScript

Constructor functions in JavaScript are special functions that are used to create and initialize objects. They serve as blueprints for creating multiple objects with similar properties and methods. Constructor functions are typically named with an uppercase letter to distinguish them from regular functions.

Here's a basic example of a constructor function in JavaScript:

```javascript
// Constructor function for creating Person objects
function Person(firstName, lastName, age) {
  this.firstName = firstName;
  this.lastName = lastName;
  this.age = age;
  
  this.greet = function() {
    console.log("Hello, my name is " + this.firstName + " " + this.lastName + ".");
  };
}

// Creating instances of Person using the constructor function
let person1 = new Person("John", "Doe", 30);
let person2 = new Person("Alice", "Smith", 35);

// Calling the greet method on each instance
person1.greet(); // Output: Hello, my name is John Doe.
person2.greet(); // Output: Hello, my name is Alice Smith.
```

Constructor functions provide a convenient way to create objects with predefined properties and methods. They allow for code reuse and encapsulation, as common properties and methods can be defined once in the constructor function and shared among multiple instances.

It's important to note that while constructor functions are a common pattern in JavaScript, ES6 introduced the class syntax, which provides a more familiar way to define classes and create objects using constructors. Under the hood, classes in JavaScript are essentially constructor functions with some syntactic sugar. However, constructor functions are still widely used, especially in legacy codebases or when targeting environments that do not support ES6 features.

## JavaScript: Objects and Prototypes

In JavaScript, the concept of objects and prototypes plays a fundamental role in how the language works.

### Objects

In JavaScript, everything except primitive values (`undefined`, `null`, boolean, number, string, symbol`) is an object:

- **Primitive Values**: Numbers, strings, booleans, `null`, and `undefined` are not objects. They are immutable and do not have properties or methods.

- **Objects**: Collections of key-value pairs, where the values can be primitives or other objects. They include plain objects, arrays, functions, dates, and more complex data structures.

- **Functions**: Functions in JavaScript are objects. They are instances of the `Function` type, which means they can have properties and methods like any other object.

- **Arrays**: Arrays in JavaScript are objects as well, with additional behavior for accessing and manipulating their elements.

- **Dates, Regular Expressions, etc.**: Other built-in types like dates (`Date`), regular expressions (`RegExp`), and more are also objects.

### Prototypes

Prototypes are a key concept related to how objects inherit properties and methods from other objects:

- **Prototype Property**: Each JavaScript object has a prototype property, pointing to another object. This prototype object acts as a fallback mechanism for property and method lookups.

- **Prototype Chain**: When accessing a property or method on an object, JavaScript checks if it exists on the object itself. If not, it follows the prototype chain until it finds the property/method or reaches the end of the chain.

- **Constructor Functions and Prototypes**: Constructor functions or classes can define prototypes using the `prototype` property. Properties/methods defined on the prototype are inherited by objects created using that constructor function.

- **Object.create()**: This method creates objects with a specific prototype.

Prototypes are crucial for achieving inheritance and code reusability in JavaScript's object-oriented features.


## Understanding the `new` Keyword in JavaScript

In JavaScript, the `new` keyword is used to create an instance of a user-defined object or a built-in constructor function. When you use `new` followed by a function call, it performs several steps:

1. **Memory Allocation**: A new object is created in memory. This object will be an instance of the constructor function.

2. **Setting Prototype**: The `[[Prototype]]` of the newly created object is set to the prototype property of the constructor function. This linkage allows the instance to inherit properties and methods from the constructor's prototype.

3. **Executing Constructor Function**: The constructor function is called with the newly created object as its context (`this`). Inside the constructor function, properties and methods can be defined for the instance by assigning them to `this`.

4. **Return**: If the constructor function doesn't explicitly return anything, the newly created object is returned implicitly. However, if a non-object value (primitive) is returned explicitly from the constructor function, the newly created object is ignored, and the returned value is used instead.

Here's a simple example to illustrate the use of `new`:

```javascript
function Person(name, age) {
  this.name = name;
  this.age = age;
}

// Creating instances using the 'new' keyword
const person1 = new Person("Alice", 30);
const person2 = new Person("Bob", 25);

console.log(person1.name); // Output: Alice
console.log(person2.age);  // Output: 25
```

## Getter and Setters in JavaScript

In JavaScript, getter and setter methods allow you to define property accessors for an object. They provide a way to control how properties are accessed and modified. Getter methods are used for retrieving the value of a property, while setter methods are used for setting or modifying the value of a property.

Here's how you can define getter and setter methods in JavaScript:

```javascript
const obj = {
  // Define a property with a getter and a setter
  _name: '',

  // Getter method
  get name() {
    return this._name;
  },

  // Setter method
  set name(newName) {
    // You can add validation or any other logic here before setting the value
    this._name = newName;
  }
};

// Accessing the property using the getter
console.log(obj.name); // Output: ''

// Setting the property using the setter
obj.name = 'John';

// Accessing the property again
console.log(obj.name); // Output: 'John'
```

In the above example, name is a property of the obj object. It has a getter method get name() which returns the value of the _name property, and a setter method set name(newName) which sets the value of the _name property. Inside the setter method, you can perform any additional logic such as validation before setting the value.

You might notice that the actual property _name starts with an underscore _. This is a common convention in JavaScript to denote that a property is meant to be private, i.e., it's not intended to be accessed directly from outside the object.

Getter and setter methods provide encapsulation and allow you to control access to object properties, ensuring data integrity and security in your JavaScript code.
